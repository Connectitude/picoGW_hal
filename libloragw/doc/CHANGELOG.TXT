Lora Gateway HAL changelog
==========================

 v1.2.1
---------------------

 * Fixed 'floating point exception' crash when concentrator returned a packet with SF=0 (CRC error on Lora header)
 * Fixed buggy timezone handling

 v1.2.0
---------------------

 * Added feature: new GPS module in the library for synchronization
 * Removed feature: no more missed deadline detection in TX because of incompatibility with GPS
 * Added documentation for GPS and legal notice
 * Added flags in Makefiles for easier cross-compilation

 v1.1.0
---------------------

 * Fixed bug 'no TX on radio B' (rfch 1)
 * Added feature: concentrator processing delay compensation in the receive() function for accurate 'end of packet' even timestamping
 * Added feature: TX 'start delay' compensation in the send() function to emit packet exactly on target timestamp
 * Added feature: timestamp counter verification in send() function, return an error if scheduling was too late
 * Switched license to 'Revised BSD'

 v1.0.0 (from beta 8)
---------------------

 * switched FTDI as default SPI phy layer in library.cfg
 * fixed a bug in TX power control; still only two TW power available, 14 and 24 dBm
 * changed library directory name from loragw_hal to libloragw to follow usual conventions

 Beta 8 (from beta 7)
---------------------

 * API: lgw_receive now return info on RX frequency and RF path for each packet (no need to keep track of RF/IF settings)
 * Unified some portion of the code with the 470 MHz variant of the HAL (use SX1255 radios instead of SX1257)
 * Improved AGC and ARB firmwares
 * Adding -Wall -Wextra for compilation, fixing all the new warnings for cleaner code
 * Fixed bugs in handling of FSK datarate
 * test_loragw_hal now dumps the content of all Lora registers after configuration in reg_dump.log

 Beta 7 (from beta 5)
---------------------

 * Reduced number of SPI transactions to fetch a packet (improved number a packets par second that can be downloaded from gateway)
 * Streamlined build process, main target is now a static library: libloragw.a
 * Change memory allocation for payload: they are now part of the struct for TX/RX, no need to malloc/free
 * All RX chains can use any of the two radios now
 * FSK is available and working in TX and RX (variable length mode)
 * Calibrated RSSI for FSK
 * lgw_connect now check the CHIP_ID
 * Added a license file and a changelog
 * Added a function returning a version string to allow identification of the version/options once compiled

 Beta 6
-------

Not a mainline release, not taken into account in that changelog.

 Beta 5 (from beta 4)
---------------------

 * Updated registers, firmware and configuration to align with r986 bitstream revision
 * Calibrated RSSI for Lora "multi" and Lora "stand alone" modems
 * Renamed some confusing TX status code
 * Preliminary FSK support

 Beta 4 (from beta 3)
---------------------

 * Unified build environment with selectable SPI layer (Linux native or FTDI SPI-over-USB bridge)
 * Remove the 500 kHz limit on radio bandwith, back to the nominal 800 kHz
 * Renamed debug flags

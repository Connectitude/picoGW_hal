Lora Gateway HAL project
=========================

1. Core library: libloragw
---------------------------

This directory contains the sources of the library to build a gateway based on 
a Semtech Lora multi-channel RF receiver.
Once compiled all the code is contained in the libloragw.a file that will be 
statically linked (ie. integrated in the final executable).

The library also comes with a bunch of basic tests programs that are used to 
test the different sub-modules of the library.

2. Helper programs
-------------------

Those programs are included in the project to provide examples on how to use 
the HAL library, and to help the system builder test different parts of it.

### 2.1. loragw_band_survey ###

This software is used to scan the RF band and measure background RSSI and some
measurement of interferer pattern.

### 2.2. loragw_pkt_logger ###

This software is used to set up a Lora concentrator using a JSON configuration
file and then record all the packets received in a log file, indefinitely, until
the user stops the application.

### 2.3. loragw_spi_stress ###

This software is used to check the reliability of the link between the host
platform (on which the program is run) and the Lora concentrator register file
that is the interface through which all interaction with the Lora concentrator
happens.

### 2.4. loragw_tx_test ###

This software is used to send test packets with a Lora concentrator. The packets
contain little information, on no protocol (ie. MAC address) information but
can be used to assess the functionality of a gateway downlink using other
gateways as receivers.
